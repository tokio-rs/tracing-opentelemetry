## Overview

[`tracing`] is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect
structured, event-based diagnostic information. This crate provides a
subscriber that connects spans from multiple systems into a trace and
emits them to [OpenTelemetry]-compatible distributed tracing systems
for processing and visualization.

The crate provides the following types:

* [`OpenTelemetryLayer`] adds OpenTelemetry context to all `tracing` [span]s.
* [`OpenTelemetrySpanExt`] allows OpenTelemetry parent trace information to be
  injected and extracted from a `tracing` [span]. It also provides methods
  to directly set span attributes (`set_attribute`), span status (`set_status`),
  and add OpenTelemetry events with dynamic attributes using the current time
  (`add_event`) or a specific timestamp (`add_event_with_timestamp`).

## Compatibility with OpenTelemetry crates

Note that version numbers for this crate are **not** synchronized with the
various OpenTelemetry crates, despite having similar version numbers. For
discussion, see [issue #170](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing-opentelemetry/issues/170).

As of 0.26, tracing-opentelemetry is one version ahead of the opentelemetry
crates, such that tracing-opentelemetry 0.26.0 is compatible with opentelemetry 0.25.0,
but due to semver compatibility concerns, this may not always be the case.

## Visualizing traces with Jaeger

```console
# Run a supported collector like jaeger in the background
$ docker run -d -p4317:4317 -p16686:16686 jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest

# Run example to produce spans (from parent examples directory)
$ cargo run --example opentelemetry-otlp

# View spans (see the image below)
$ firefox http://localhost:16686/
```

## Feature Flags

 - `metrics`: Enables the [`MetricsLayer`] type, a [layer] that
   exports OpenTelemetry metrics from specifically-named events. This enables
   the `metrics` feature flag on the `opentelemetry` crate.
